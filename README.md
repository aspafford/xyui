# XY UI Test

A simple web application for experimenting with a 2D (X,Y) coordinate input interface that can be used to control audio parameters.

## Features

- Interactive 2D coordinate system with a center point at (0,0)
- Real-time display of X and Y coordinates (-1 to 1 range)
- Click and drag functionality to set coordinates
- Visual canvas with grid and axes for easy reference

## Purpose

This project explores UI interactions for controlling multiple audio parameters with a single interface element using mouse/touch position and gestures.

## Development

This project was built with React and Vite.

### Running the project

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Planned Features

- Mapping X/Y coordinates to different audio parameters
- Supporting touch events and gestures
- Exploring different visualization options
- Adding parameter smoothing and constraints
